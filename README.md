Project Overview.

All basic functionality requirements are implemented within the project. 

Some notes on what I could've done better:
I started make api calls in unique files to check if things were working. This led to my foolish decision to not make a api hook for this. 
If I were to redo this I would for sure do that. 
I also attempted to create a create product feature. I edited the backend file to attempt to add this but in the end I couldn't get it to work.

I did take on the discount extra credit. Both the discount application and admin editing work. 

Overall very fun project :)
